# 📘 Arocheaverse Docs

Welcome to **Arocheaverse Docs** — the official documentation and creative handbook for everything inside the **Arocheaverse** 🌸  

This is where we keep the behind-the-scenes notes, design rules, and development roadmaps that guide every project under the Arocheaverse umbrella — from ArocheaPlays to Arochea’s Archives.

## 🪐 Purpose
The goal of this repository is to serve as a **shared source of truth** for both creative direction and technical structure.  
Every color, logo, tone, and tool across the Arocheaverse should feel consistent, cozy, and carefully crafted.

- 🗺️ Project plans and timelines  
- 🖋️ Writing, lore, and brand tone notes  
- 🧩 Technical documentation (stack, deployment, etc.)  
- 🎨 Design guidelines and aesthetic references  
- 📋 Feature roadmaps and changelogs
